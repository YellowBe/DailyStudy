## First, how to build the model in pytorch? / how is a model like in pytorch
+ in main func, define a func to return a model class
    ```
    model = build_model(args.model, num_classes=args.classes)
    def build model():
        return ERFNet()
    ```
## func in torch
+ nn.Conv2d
    +  Applies a 2D convolution over an input signal composed of several input planes / 对由多个输入平面组成的输入信号进行二维卷积
